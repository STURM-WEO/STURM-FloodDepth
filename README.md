# STURM-FloodDepth
A deep learning pipeline for estimating urban flood depth from street-level imagery. Developed as part of the STURM Project, this repository provides code, models, and workflows for detecting vehicles, enhancing image resolution, and classifying flood depth levels using opportunistic sensing data. Designed for integration with early warning systems and disaster response platforms.

## Data Privacy and Usage
- **Data Sources**: The project prioritizes the use of image sources from the public domain. In case of new data collection, please ensure compliance with data usage policies and with all applicable laws and regulations, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- **Ethical Considerations**: Be mindful of privacy concerns, especially regarding images that may contain personal information. Human body parts are deliberately excluded to eliminate potential biases associated
with gender, age, or other factors.
