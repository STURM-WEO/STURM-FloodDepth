# STURM-FloodDepth
A deep learning pipeline for estimating urban flood depth from street-level imagery. Developed as part of the STURM Project, this repository provides code, models, and workflows for detecting vehicles, enhancing image resolution, and classifying flood depth levels using opportunistic sensing data. Designed for integration with early warning systems and disaster response platforms.
